A [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) plugin enabling HomeKit support for camera with any phones, tablets, laptops, computers : everything that have a camera, a network access and a not too old/crappy browser

*Note that this is an unofficial plugin.*

## Prerequisites

* Plug your phone/laptop/tablet in! :electric_plug:
* Configure it to never sleep
* Configure it to access to local network by Wifi
* Configure it to minimal brightness

Optional : 
* Use a gooseneck clamp holder

## Installation
1. Install Homebridge by following
   [the instructions](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki).
2. Install this plugin by running :
```bash
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-browsercam
```
3. On your phone/laptop, connect to [https://localhost](https://localhost) : you need to accept the bad certificate warning (you can't have a real certificate on local networks, see [#configuration](#markdown-header-configuration). The S in https is MANDATORY. Screen pass to black when device is avalaible on HomeKit
4. On HomeKit app tap on 'Add accessory'
5. Enjoy ;-)

## Features 
* Snapshoting
* Streaming
* Recording
* Motion Sensor (An OpenCV movement detector is running in background)
* Torch if present become a light switch

## Configuration

### SSL Certificate
If your network own a public domain, you can use a signed SSL certificate : 
replace key.pem and cert.pem in .homebridge/browsercam folder and restart

### Devices

#### Android :
The best choice for that project, I personally use an old and crappy Huawei

#### iPhone : 
You can't have 'torch' option : it will be not presented in HomeKit

#### Laptop :
Facing Mode is automatically at 'environment' value, but in this case, "user" value is preferred
